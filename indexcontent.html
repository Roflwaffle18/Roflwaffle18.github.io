   <ul>
    <li>Presented in front of the class</li>

    <li>From the last update there are a few key point to note:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Soldered the PCB extension mentioned in last week's update</li>

        <li>Printed off a PCB from the Prototype Lab, rough estimated cost of production is about $25</li>
        <li>I bought $5 worth of components for our little PCB add-on module for our Raspberry Pi 3.</li>

      </ul>
    <li>Next Steps:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>After today I will be printing off my PCB and soldering it by next week</li>
        <li>Last thing to do after that would be to print off the box and cleaning up the code</li>

   <ul>
    <li>From the last update there are a few key point to note:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>A PCB extension for our solar panel and temperature sensor circuit has be designed and sent to the prototype lab to be printed (last week)</li>
        <li>This week we are soldering that PCB today in class to test out and if it works I will be printing my PCB board and soldering it by next week</li>
        <li>Also today in class we will be designing a case for our project</li>

    <li><a href="Week 11/Progress Report Nov. 15, 2016 - Salvatore Angilletta.docx" download>Progress Report - Nov. 15, 2016</a></li>
    <li>The current state of the project is mostly unchanged from last week due to a massive amount of work for other classes.</li>
    <li>From the last update there are a few key point to note:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>A PCB extension for our solar panel and temperature sensor circuit has be designed and sent to the prototype lab to be printed</li>
        <li>I went to the Humber College open house on November. 12, 2016 to gather feedback from the general public and fellow classmates on improvements/what people think about the project</li>
        <li>Feedback was mostly positive from the general public, lots of comments about the dynamic bar representation of data, other feedback was mostly about the design of our project (looking for a more polished end product)</li>

        <li>Permission was asked from Oliver, William, Sanjay and Kevin if I could use this picture for my blog</li>

    <li>Finacial Update:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>There are no changes to the budget of the project. I am still about $150 under budget and I have spent a total of $148.73 to date.</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Next Steps:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>After the open house there are plans to solder and test </li>
        <li>Plans to make some improvements to the python script to display voltage and lux in their respective measurements</li>
        <li>Plans to make a project box to store the project</li>

    <li>The current state of the project is unchanged from last week due to a massive amount of work for other classes.</li>
    <li>From the last update there has been a few key points to note:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>A finalized circuit has been made to gather data from the solar panel</li>
        <li>The i2c ports on the modular sensor hat has been used in order to simplify the circuit</li>
        <li>A program has been made in python script to gather and display the data from all the sensors plus the solar panel</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Finacial Update:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>There are no changes to the budget of the project</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Next Steps:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>After the open house there are plans to simplify the circuit for the solar panel into another PCB to make life easier and look nicer</li>
        <li>Plans to make some improvements to the python script to display voltage and lux in their respective measurements, may come before the open house but definately afterwards for sure</li>
        <li>Plans to make a project box to store the project</li>

    <li><a href="Week 6/Progress Report Oct. 11, 2016 - Salvatore Angilletta.docx" download>Progress Report - Oct. 11, 2016</a></li>
    <li>A circuit has been made for our project and has been assembled. Initial testing of the solar panel has been done as well, it achieved a result of three volts under regular lighting conditions in the Humber Labs.</li>
    <li>A resistor has been added to the circuit between the Raspberry Pi and the solar panel in case our solar panel reaches a voltage higher than three volts. This was added to prevent the Raspberry Pi from getting damaged as it cannot accept any voltage higher than 3.3 volts on the GPIO pins.</li>
    <li>Finacial Update:</li>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Financial status of our project has been effected by the drop of the motion sensor. This effects the budget by subtracting $14.81 from the total price.</li>
        <li>There is still an item not purchased, it is not mentioned on the budget either. It is nylon screws, nylon standoffs and heat shrink wrap. These components are not required with our current progress as of yet because they are for the project box and finishing touches</li>
        <li>We managed to save $25.08 in shipping since we bought all components from one place. </li>
        <li>I also found a pair of wire cutters at home which saved me $20.</li>
        <li>I am under budget by approximately $150 at the current moment. That concludes the current progress status of our project.</li>
